# Reading: Chapter 5 - Statistics

This is a challenging chapter. Statistical concepts are challenging. This class covers descriptive statistics, which help us describe our data. Another branch of statistics, inferential statistics, helps us make predictions using our data. (We'll start to cover this in Chapter 7)

As the author defines these concepts, try to think about what he's doing. We will be using these tools in later chapters and in class. If you're having trouble with any of these concepts, don't sweat it. You'll gain more understanding as we re-use them throughout the rest of the class.

There is no additional homework for this class. Just work your way thru the code.
