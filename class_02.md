#Reading: Chapter 2 - *A Crash Course in Python*

This chapters covers basic Python data structures very quickly. You should type all of the code in this class into a Jupyter Notebook, and run it, to make sure you get it. 

If you have any trouble getting your code to run, talk to Dan. 

There is a lot to cover in this class, and we will have two make-ups. Feel free to attend as many of them as possible. 

#Assignment: my_name_stats.py

I want you to try to write a simple python function that asks for someone to enter their name, and then tells them a lot of **COOL, HIP** things about their name, like:
* How long their name is
* What are the letters in their name
* How many times do those letters appear
* And if you're feeling really ambitious, if their name is a **PALINDROME**

Here are some hints to get you started: 
* Use the python function raw_input to ask for the name. It works like this
```x = raw_input("What's your favorite color? ") ```
