# Reading: Chapter 4 - Linear Algebra

Don't be thrown off by the title. You'll only need to understand very basic arithmetic to understand this chapter. 

# Your Assignment - Practicing loops

Loops are hard. Especially know when to end them. But getting comfortable with looping is a critical step in learning to program. 

For this assingment, attempt Problems 1 and 2 from this problem set: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-4-machine-interpretation-of-a-program/MIT6_00SCS11_ps1.pdf

For these two problems, you'll be using a powerfully dumb algorithm called "guess and check". The last problem, Problem 3, uses a very cool algorithm called bisection search. If you'd like to try it, let's chat.
