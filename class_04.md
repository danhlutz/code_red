# Reading: Chapter 4 - Linear Algebra

Don't be thrown off by the title. You'll only need to understand very basic arithmetic to understand this chapter. 

# Your Assignment - Practicing loops

Loops are hard. Especially know when to end them. But getting comfortable with looping is a critical step in learning to program. 

For this assingment, attempt Problems 1 and 2 from this [problem set](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-4-machine-interpretation-of-a-program/MIT6_00SCS11_ps1.pdf) * 

* NOTE: This problem set is from John Guttag's **excellent** intro to programming class. The entire class is available for [free online from MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/). You should take it!

For these two problems, you'll be using a powerfully dumb algorithm called "guess and check". The last problem, Problem 3, uses a very cool algorithm called bisection search. If you'd like to try it, let's chat. 

# Class agenda

* Chapter review: What problems did you run into running the code? 

* Looping practice

    * Problem 01

        * how can we break Problem 01 into smaller functions? 

    * the ```while``` loop and an example

        * making sure your while loop doesn't run forever

    * Problem 02: guess and check

    * Problem 03: introduction to bisection search
