## Code Red: Learning Python for Trade Union Data Science

# Class 0: Getting Started

Welcome! At our first class we will
* Talk about why we're taking this class and how we hope to use Python in our work and activism
* Make sure we all have the required programs
* Practice using the Jupyter Notebook for writing and executing our Python code
* Volunteer to facilitate future courses. 

## Get the textbook

We'll be reading *Data Science From Scratch* by Joel Grus. In this book, Joel re-implements some of the most important data science and machine learning algorithms from scratch (Book is here: https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X)

## Class format

Each class will cover one chapter of the textbook. 

Before each class, each participant is expected to work thru the assigned chapter of the textbook, type in the code, and try to make it work. During the class we'll discuss both the concepts of the chapter and problems we ran into with the code. 

## Before Class 0

1. Read Chapter 1 of the book. The author includes lots of code samples. Try to read them, but if you don't understand them, that's fine. Understanding will come later. 
2. Install Python on your computer: 
* Use Anaconda Python, Python 2.7 version. This installs Python plus many of the scientific libraries used by Python data scientists. (https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

I recommend that you install these programs on a laptop so you can bring it to class. Thanks to Anaconda, Python and all its scientific libraries will work on Windows, but you may be happier on a Mac.
