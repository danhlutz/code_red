# possible topics for our new course

We are considering redirecting our class to look at more tips for writing in Python. 

Here are some possible topics for future classes. I think we'll have the most success if we discuss a few possible things. Let's discuss!


## computer science-y topics

* how to sort 

* recursion

* curve fitting 

* "Object-Oriented Programming" 

* graph algorithms

## work topics

* working with csv files
  * data cleaning
  * running functions on your data

* talking to the internet
  * requests and APIs
  * scraping

* more plotting
